# Sloan Funding Dat Development

We’ve got two happy pieces of news at the U.S. Open Data Institute.

The first is that board member [Max Ogden](http://maxogden.com/) is transitioning to being an employee, as we start to house and support [Dat](http://datproject.org/), Max’s data package management tool. Dat is a system for real-time replication, transformation, and versioning of large tabular datasets. Git is to source code as Dat is to datasets. [The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation provided $50,000](http://maxogden.com/) to support taking Dat from an idea to [a pre-alpha stage](https://github.com/maxogden/dat/), which sustained the project until February. Now it's becoming a US ODI project.

This is possible because of the second announcement: the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](http://www.sloan.org/) has provided $260,000 in funding to support the continued development of Dat. That money will be used to pay Max and two additional developers to spend the year growing Dat into a vibrant, healthy, widely used open source project. Sloan's interest is in seeing Dat used in the sciences, which produces a great deal of data, but for reasons both cultural and technological, does not generally publish that data openly. We intend to play a role in changing that.

Max got started yesterday. You can follow along with development of Dat at [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/maxogden/dat/).

Our thanks to Josh Greenberg and the Sloan Foundation for their generosity and gracious support. We're also grateful to Casey Dachs and the [Miami Foundation](https://www.miamifoundation.org/), and the folks at the Knight Foundation for their important help in making this possible.
