Today we’re announcing the release of Dat Desktop, a peer to peer data sharing
app built for humans.

Dat Desktop is a new way to share data with friends & colleagues. Using the
peer to peer (p2p) Hyperdrive protocol, it makes sharing folders on your
computer secure and convenient. No centralized servers needed.

## Installing Dat Desktop

You can [download Dat Desktop here][download] and read [the source code

GitHub][issues], reach us [on Twitter][twitter] or drop by on

## Hyperdrive Protocol

The Hyperdrive protocol is a protocol for p2p directories. It was designed to
efficiently share terabytes of of scientific data in real time between research
institutions on multiple continents, but it works fine to share text files on
the local network too

## Updating Dat Desktop

You only have to install Dat Desktop once - we’ll make sure you’ll always be
running the latest and greatest. Some of the features to come include:

- preview modes for a wide range of data formats
- tagging, versioning and shapshotting of Archives
- publishing Archives to Dat Registry and Dat Cloud (coming soon™)
- forever improving stability and performance

We hope you have as much fun using Dat Desktop as we do building it. Thanks and
have a happy 2017!
