### using shipit for deployment and install
[shipit](https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit) and [shipit-deploy](https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit-deploy) depends on rsync version 3+, git version 1.7.8+, and OpenSSH version 5+. To upgrade rsync on a macosx machine, [follow instructions here](https://static.afp548.com/mactips/rsync.html) (see "compile rsync 3.0.7" section).

install shipit-cli locally, globally:
```
npm install shipit-cli -g
```

the config file is `shipitfile.js`. you'll need to set the environment var `DATLAND_USER` in your local shell for it to know which account to use to access the server.

to test your access to machine via shipit from your local command line, call shipit, then the environment (in this case `uat`, which is tracking the master branch), then the actual command which corresponds to tasks defined in the shipitfile:
```
shipit uat pwd
```

to deploy and install a build on remote machine (note that shipit pulls build source from github, not your local project dir):
```
npm run deploy
```
