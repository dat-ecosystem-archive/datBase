This week, we’re excited to release [the next version of datproject.org](https://datproject.org) that includes a public dat peer. This public peer will connect to dats and preview their contents in the browser ([release notes](https://github.com/datproject/datproject.org/releases/tag/1.02)). This means that your collaborators can view and download a file under 10MB without having dat installed on their machine!

## A Public Dat Peer

Now, datproject.org will act as a centralized peer that caches files and metadata on it’s server-side filesystem hosted on Digital Ocean. Data is downloaded and re-hosted when you visit `https://datproject.org/f34d58370…`. It will attempt to connect to the dat and display its file list.

</div>

This view previews the list of the latest files that were added to the dat, along with the last time they were edited as well as the size of each file. This file list is now cached on our server to improve speed and reliability.

If the directory list won’t load, it might be because your dat is hosted behind a firewall or on a slow internet connection. Check [these troubleshooting tips](https://docs.datproject.org/dat#troubleshooting) and the [FAQ](https://docs.datproject.org/faq) to see if that helps you.

You can click on a file to preview its contents. This is also cached on our server in *plaintext*, so please don’t trust it with your life! This is still an experimental feature and we do not guarantee the cache – your data could be removed from our peer at any time.

This public peer is great for sending quick links to friends and colleagues, but maybe not so great for permanent storage. If you need help hosting a dat on a permanent server, check out the [guide for hosting dats from a server.](https://www.datprotocol.com/guides/hosting-dats-from-a-server.html)

## Security

Server-side caching has tradeoffs between security and usability and we’ve prioritized usability in this release. Since we haven’t had a security audit yet, don’t trust your life with datproject.org right now.

## Coming next

  * View the name and author of the dat, specified in the dat.json file.
  * Permanent links to files within the dat.
  * Go back in time – view older versions of the dat, including the file contents if they’re still served over the network.
  * Render text files incrementally so that even large ones can be previewed.
  * Create an account on datproject.org to publish a shortname for a dat.

## Found a bug?

We’re always on the bug hunt. Shoot us a message on #dat in freenode, or [file a bug report on our GitHub repository](http://github.com/datproject/datproject.org).
